# Credit Card fraud detection using Machine learning and Neural Network
Final project for Statistical Machine Learning CSE 575

## Project Title
**Optimizing Credit Card Fraud Detection Through Imbalanced Dataset Management and Feature Analysis**

## Motivation
This project addresses the urgent need to combat the rising threat of credit card fraud in today's digital world. By analyzing transaction data and identifying patterns indicative of fraud, it aims to improve the accuracy of detection algorithms. The research seeks to empower businesses to strengthen their fraud detection mechanisms, ensuring a safer and more secure digital economy for all stakeholders.

## Dataset
The dataset aims to model past credit card transactions, including known instances of fraud, to develop a predictive model for identifying fraudulent transactions in the future. The goal is to detect as many fraudulent transactions as possible while minimizing incorrect classifications. Employed pandas for data loading and pre-processing to ensure data integrity and readiness for analysis.
